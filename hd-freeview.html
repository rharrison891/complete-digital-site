        <h1>HD & Freeview</h1>

        <p>
            Freeview HD delivers crystal-clear high-definition TV using your existing aerial, offering sharper picture quality and improved sound without any monthly subscription.
            With new hybrid platforms such as <strong>Freely</strong>, you can now combine traditional terrestrial broadcasts with online streaming for even more content options.
        </p>

        <h2>What You Need for Freeview HD</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HD-ready TV with a Freeview HD tuner</strong> – most modern TVs support this.</li>
            <li><strong>DVB-T2 reception</strong> – essential for HD channels such as BBC One HD, ITV HD, and Channel 4 HD.</li>
            <li><strong>Good aerial signal</strong> – a properly aligned and installed digital aerial ensures the best HD performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Regular retuning</strong> – keeps your channel list updated as new channels and services launch.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Freely & Hybrid TV Options</h2>

        <p>
            Freely brings live channels and on-demand content together using both your aerial and your internet connection.
            This means:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access to live Freeview channels even with a weak signal (online fallback).</li>
            <li>No subscriptions required — just connect your TV to Wi-Fi.</li>
            <li>A unified, modern TV experience across live and catch-up content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Recommended Setup Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Position your aerial for the strongest local transmitter.</li>
            <li>Use a high-quality coaxial cable to reduce interference.</li>
            <li>A powered amplifier may help in weak-signal areas (but isn’t always required).</li>
            <li>Enable “Automatic Updates” on your TV to keep channels and apps current.</li>
        </ul>
